<p>Arena of Evolution, the <span class="notranslate">Auto Chess</span> rip-off that soft launched on Android recently, has reportedly rolled out in more territories.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to be a full global release but players in America and Germany are reporting that it&#8217;s available in their countries now.</p>
<h2>Arena of Evolution is basically <span class="notranslate">Auto Chess</span> on mobile</h2>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of this yet, it&#8217;s a new strategy game that draws an awful lot of inspiration from <span class="notranslate">Auto Chess</span>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a Dota spin-off in which you set all of your strategical options before the battle and then watch it play out. It&#8217;s pretty novel.</p>
<p>There are over 60 heroes to collect here, all of which you can upgrade to increase their power or simply customise their play style.</p>
