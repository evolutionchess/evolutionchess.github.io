## New Feature
 
### Auto Level-up
Redesigned the level-up feature. Please first try it!
 
### Balance of Heroes

#### Mindbreaker
 
The ability given to her sounds reasonable, while in real battles you may only find “disgusting” to describe his skill. They must have felt very sad that some players were driven mad by this shameless worm. 
· It will cost more to buy her, 3 gold coins. And her basic stats is correspondingly improved.
· Charming time will decrease to 5s/6.5s/8s from 6s/8s/10s
· If Mindbreaker is killed, the unit which is charmed will return normal immediately.
· The Mindbreaker will randomly choose an enemy to charm, rather than choose the highest HP one in previous version.
· When your mindbreak spider charms an enemy spider, and the enemy spider then charms another enemy unit1, unit1 will not switch camp permanently.
 
#### Mortus
Mortus's endless cloak duration must be one of the factors that may extend the battle period. While his skill seems so special, so they decide to give him more freedom based on the some adjustments of his skills.   
· Cloak cooldown time will extend to 16s from 11s/10s/9s.
· Cloak actually lasts 6s in real battles, instead of 4s as described in his info. They correct the time.  
· Cooldown starts the moment his skill is launched, which means the 6s Cloak duration is included in the CD.
· During Cloak, Mortus's speed will additionally increase by 30%/40%/50%.
 
#### Cruiser
Too absorded in your fighting? How about taking a break bro? 
· Dive Bomb cooldown will extend to 14s/12s/10s/ from 10s/8s/6s.
 
#### Hailstorm
Overwhelming 5-gold superhero. After the launch of an attack, here is the animation of the next... 
· Devastator cooldown time extends to 14s/12s/10s/ from 10s/10s/10s.
 
#### Kamikaze
A lovely boy when he have fewer stars. As an insectoid, he grows a bit too fast. They decide to increase his price, so that he can happily explore.
· Kamikaze will cost 2 gold coins, with basic stats improved.
· Range will decrease to 2 grids from 3.
 
#### Ironbird
To make Ironbird an acceptable Longshot.
· Shooting range increases to 4 grids from 3.
 
#### Acidtooth
Acidtooth seems to start making the poision just when is dragged to the board, which could be checked from his long cooldown time. They need to supply him. 
· Skill cooldown time decreases to 10s/8s/6s from 20s.
 
#### Commando
Cheers!
· His range increases to 7 grid instead of 4 before.
 
#### Chan Master
When Chan Master encounters Psyker team, he may lose life for the anti-damage. Which hurt this elder's tyranny.
· The difference of his attack damages increases, with the total damage remains unchanged.
 
#### Skyclaw
Be careful!
· When Skyclaw lands on the ground, the items on him and synergy he has will keep.
 
### Balance of Synergy
 
#### Mech & Vanguard
Sodiers seem to be a little weak, which should not happen. They decide to switch the synergy of Mech and Vangard, and enhance both of them.
· Mech synergy will change to Restoration, friendly Mechs will get +15/+35 restoration from previously enhancing the armor by +4/+8
· Vanguard synergy will be adjusted to have +6/+8 armor from restoring life by +10/+15.
 
#### Longshot
The sybergy of longshot is slightly enhanced for Longshot team fans to carry battle's post-period.  
· +3/+7 armor penetration is adjusted to +4/+8.
 
#### Beast
Have a beast party!
· Speed increase will be +15%/+25%/+35%.  
· The synergy advantage of 4 beasts will take affect to all the allies.
 
#### Marine
Marine's win.
·  Marine will decrease enemy armor by 3/6/9.
 
#### Rider
·  All enemies' energy restoration reduce 3.
 
#### Specialist
Specialist will suit the war of attrition more.
·  Specialist synergy changes to all allies gain lifesteal by 5%/5%/10%
