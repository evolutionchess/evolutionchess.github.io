When clicking on the Leaderboard to see which kind of composition pro players usually used, I was surprised that despite lots of different builds there are, all of them share the same synergy: Immortal. Thanks to Oiwa_ (an user on reddit), we will understand why this build is insanely strong and how you can build your own undefeatable Immortal army!

## Immortal Guide

I only recently started playing this game, but I have been testing many builds and so far this has been my most successful. This build feels insanely powerful in the mid/late game and has given me multiple wins and many top 3 placements. The early game can be weak, so you need to focus on building “bridge” synergies in order to save health or don’t and trade blood for gold while pushing your luck.

The goal of the build was to get the double or triple immortal bonus as fast as possible while letting RNG do most of the work. This strategy requires buying and selling a lot of pieces to survive early game while stockpiling your gold and key pieces on the bench. ALWAYS remember that you don’t want to fight your rolls, buy what you can for the synergies you can make now because you can sell them for the synergies you want later.


### ALWAYS BUY WHEN AVAILABLE:
- Vinegarden (Immortal Specialist)
- Skyclaw (Raptor/Beast/Vanguard)
- Sunfire (Raptor Blaster)
- Bonewyrm (Immortal Raptor Siegebreaker)
- Devourer (Raptor Specialist)
- Forest Ranger (Immortal Vanguard)
- Hailstorm (Mech Blaster)

### IDEAL FINAL BUILD

Immortal x3 | Vanguard x3 | Beast x2 | Raptor x4 | Specialist x2 | Mech x2 | Blaster x3 | Walker x1
Vinegarden, Bonewyrm, Forest Rager | Skyclaw, Tusker or Acidtooth, Forest Rager | Skyclaw, Tusker or Acidtooth | Skyclaw, Bone Dragon, Sunfire, Devourer | Vinewarden, Devourer | Gorilla, Hailstorm | Sunfire, Bone Dragon, Tempest Keeper | Tempest Keeper

1. Tusker or Acidtooth
2. Skyclaw
3. Gorilla
4. Hailstorm
5. Sunfire
6. Vinegarden
7. Bonewyrm
8. Devourer
9. Forest Rager
10. Tempest Keeper

### EARLY GAME

So the early game is the trickiest part. You need to think about the synergies that are important to the build, while focusing on the ones available.

Good starting Synergies:

#### Level 1-2
- Mech x2
    - When I’m running this build I prioritize picking up Gorilla and Marauder in the first few rounds. Having both of them gives you the double Mech bonus and if you can grab a 3rd blaster, you get the 3 Blaster bonus as well.

- Beast x2
    - Ideally you want to pick up Tusker and Acidtooth if they’re both available. Focus on getting them to level 2 and after that, focus on one of them to level 3 because you’ll most likely sell one off later.


#### Level 3-6
- 2 Mechs?
    - Pick up a Blaster (Hierophant or Kamikaze are really your only options here.)

- 2 Beasts?
    - Depending on which 2 Beasts you have, you can play around a bit.
    - If Marauder and Gorilla become available, play them at level 4.
    - If you have Acidtooth and Tusker, get another vanguard.
    - If you have either Acidtooth or Tusker and a different beast as your second, buy from what’s available that will work with what you’re building too. For Example:
    - You don’t get Marauder or Gorilla, but you see a Hierophant, grab him because your chances of getting them is still hair enough to get the blaster/mech synergies

- If you’re not getting either synergy complete, focus on getting pieces for when you do.
    - I have Acidtooth and Gorilla on the board but I didn’t roll anything I that works with them right now, however I did get a Panda Monk and a Hierophant. It’s level 3 so I put one of them on the board, perhaps Panda Monk since he’s tankier. The next round I get another Gorilla and a Kamikaze. I’m level 4 so I pull my Acidtooth and Panda Monk back to the bench and Put my 2 Gorillas at the front and my Hierophant and Kamikaze a square behind them. (This give me the blaster bonus, and then I can hope for a better roll on the next one)


- If I got super lucky, I’d want to have some of the pieces from the ideal final build making up my team or at least on the bench waiting to be played. The most typical pieces I have by this time (level 6) are: Marauder, Gorilla, Hierophant, Acidtooth, Tusker, and any 3rd vanguard (I typically don’t bother leveling my 3rd vanguard because he is a placeholder).



### MID/LATE GAME

During mid game, you are focusing on getting pieces from the ideal build, leveling, earning interest, and leveling your pieces. If you get a Sunfire and Hierophant is still level 1, replace him on the board then sell him. If he’s level 2, hold Sunfire until you have room for him or he’s level 2 because his passive doesn’t come online until them. If you get Skyclaw, replace your weakest vanguard with him. At level 7 and 8, you want to get your immortals on the board, which hopefully you’ve been leveling on the bench. If you get Hailstorm, replace Marauder even if Marauder is level 2 because Hailstorm is a much better piece than him. Don’t replace Gorilla though because he is very strong when leveled so you want to try to get him to level 3 if possible.

From here on, you want to focus on buying only ideal pieces and leveling your pieces. Don’t worry about leveling too fast until you get your next piece. When you get Forest Rager, replace Acidtooth or Tusker, and your 9th and 10th pieces ideally should be Devourer and Tempest Keeper.

If you aren’t getting the other pieces you want, it’s super easy to go Siegebreaker and/or Kraken late game thanks to how the build currently works.

### NOTE

Now this build leaves a little room for counter building, but the best way to counter is positioning. If you’re in the Late Game and you’re losing to one player over and over again. Look at their build and how they’re doing damage.

Are they doing massive amounts of Aoe Damage to you? Consider using split positioning.

Do they have Assassins jumping behind you and killing your damage dealers? Maybe move some tank guys back a step.

Are their main damage dealers air units? Instead of trying to get Devourer, grab another siegebreaker so you have 3. This gives you bonus damage against their air units. If you’re only level 8, don’t have the gold to level up, consider pulling pieces back to the bench to get the siegebreaker bonus online faster. This will lose you some of your bonuses but if you have 3 Immortals, you can pull 1 back to the bench (whichever is weakest). If you don’t have Devourer, you can pull a raptor off the board too and still have 2 of them. Just remember, you only need to do this if you are taking an immense mount of damage and are close to losing, but once you do, level as fast as possible and get what you took off back on the board.


There’s a ton to consider when countering, but this is really up to you. See how their pieces are attacking, which of your pieces aren’t getting their abilities off because they’re dying too fast, etc.. It’s all really situational so its up to you. I’m no expert at this game, but this has been my favorite way to play since working it out because it is so easy to build and I’ve had more than a few times with 10-15 win streaks in the Late Game because of it.

Hope you guys found this useful and any input is greatly appreciated.
