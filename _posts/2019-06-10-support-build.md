__Caution:__ this is not a joke to you!

Since Engineer is only cost 1 gold now and level 2 supports has a huge buff in health and mana restore, full support is a very strong composition, especially in late game. The 4 supports synergy can keep your army always stay at full health and it also very fun to play.

By the way, you actually will have 3 or more ADC and some aoe damage dealer. The "1 ADC" on the title is just for fun :)). It's remind me of the epic LOL's strategy.

## 4 Supporters Guide

The goal of the game is to get the 4 supporters as soon as possible. With the new Engineer which only cost 1 gold, you will have no trouble getting 3 supporters in the first 10 round. The last piece to this build is Soulmentor, which you have to be lucky to get because he's not a common chess hero.

Because supporters has the least damage outputs. You will need a (or more) ranged damage carrier. Any longshot hero can do it. Some of the blaster heroes which have powerful aoe damage would be a great mix, such as Outrider or specially the Sunfire god.

### ALWAYS BUY WHEN AVAILABLE:
- Medic (Marine - Supporter)
- Chanter (Psyker - Supporter)
- Engineer (Air Force - Supporter)
- Soulmentor (Beast - Supporter)
- Sunfire (Raptor - Blaster)
- Skyclaw (Raptor - Beast - Vanguard)

### CONDITIONAL BUY
- One (or more) <b>Longshot</b> hero (any hero is fine, the more coin the better)
- Hailstorm (Mech - Blaster)
- Outrider (Rider - Blaster)
- Hierophant (Psyker - Blaster)

### EARLY GAME
The early game is the hardest stage of your life. Try not to lose too much HP on these first rounds!

At this stage you should not buy a longshot hero yet. Took a strong melee hero can make your life easier, Vajra and any Beast hero should do the work. Assassins can also be fine, but they usually jump to the back of the enemies, which make your Medic and Chanter useless.

Tries to make 2 or 3 synergies as soon as possible. Such as:

#### Marine
You already have Medic in your must buy list, and she's usually available in the first 3 rounds. Another Marine is not so hard to find. Try to avoid picking Sniper if you got another choice, he's horrible! Commando is the greatest mix.

#### Psyker
Buy one of these whenever possible. Psyker synergy is too strong, especially their heroes can work very well with your supporter mix. Thunderer, Hierophant is preferred!

#### Beast, Air Force or any class that you like the most
Because Supporters cover a large range of class. Build 2 or more class synergy is very easy!

### MID GAME

This stage won't last long! With this build, all of your chess pieces would be so cheap that make you very rich and can reach late game sooner than any other players.

#### Looking for Soulmentor
At this stage you should have 3 supporters, Soulmentor is the missing piece to the mix. Buy him at anycost!

#### Find a perfect ADC
You won't have to worry about your defends when you got Soulmentor. With the level 2 support synergy, your chess heroes should always stay at full health whenever a weak supporter died. What you have to do now is looking for a source of damages.

Feeding your ADC, make hime the strongest piece in your chess. Remember to place your ADC in somewhere safe, out of the Assassins reach! If they can oneshot (or more) your damage carrier, you will likely lose the round.

#### Group as many synergies as possible
As I've said before, supporters cover a large range of class. At this stage you should got no problem founding 4 or more synergies!

### LATE GAME
This is the stage when you're shine. All you have to do is reach Lv.10 as soon as possible and keep recycling the shop to find 2 or 3-star hero for your chess. It's not very hard to find a 3-star Medic, Chanter or Engineer!

Supporter late game is not considering lack of damage output. In the contrary, because you only need 4 slot for your core heros, you have so much choice for buying good damage dealer. Supporters hero can also be tank in this stage as they can sacrifice themselves for (400 healths and 20 manas) x (9 or less) heroes, which can keep your army alive for doing damage. You wouldn't need any tanks (but 1 or 2 is preferred). Focus on buying high damage heroes, such as Sunfire, Chan Master or any 5-coin heroes.

### NOTE
This build have a very big weakness, which make counter is very possible. It's very vulnerable to Assassins mix which can one shot everything. With the player that have good skill in positioning, he can put his Assassin in a perfect place that he can kill all your carriers, leaving your supporter hopelessly crawling for damage.
