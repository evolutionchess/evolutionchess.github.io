*"What does it feel like to love someone? It seems that suddenly you have weakness, but suddenly you have an armor."*

Did you think that it was some kind of romantical status? Nah, Ironshell finally released. As a new composition to the psyker army, he also open many more composition to other synergies as well. With Ironshell, Psyker's only weakness is not a problem anymore. They now have strong DPS damage, AOE dealer and Tanking heroes of their own.

## Psyker Era

Psyker power is just like a helicopter, they keep rising and hadn't received any nerf since the game released. Psyker synergy (friendly Psyker/allies reflect 20 true damage when being attacked) works very well with tanking unit, so the goal of the game is to get 4 psykers as soon as possible then army your chess with a bunch of tankers. Since Ironshell is a tanking unit itself, an ideal army can have like 7 tankers. Each of them deal a bunch of damage when they hit their enemy and a bunch of damage when their enemy hit them!

However tanker unit itself very vulnerable to AOE damage. Heroes like Sunfire or Hailstorm can rip your whole army away within 10 seconds or less, so position your units carefully. One of the best way to do this is using the "Avoiding AOE Formation". If you don't know how to do, read this article: [Unit Positioning Guide](/guide/2019/06/12/unit-positioning-guide.html#avoiding-aoe-mid---late-game){:target="_blank"}.

### ALWAYS BUY WHEN AVAILABLE:
- Ironshell (Psyker - Guardian)
- Chanter (Psyker - Supporter)
- Illusionist (Psyker - Puppet - Summoner)
- Hierophant (Psyker - Blaster) / Thunderer (Psyker - Longshot)
- Bulwark (Puppet - Guardian)

### CONDITIONAL BUY
- Vajra (Walker - Guardian) - Walker are such a strong Spec that every army should have one. In this composition, Vajra is prefered because of his Guardian class
- Soulmentor (Beast - Supporter) - If you got Chanter on your team then this is a must. Supporter goes very well with tanking unit, since they can heal so much lost HP because of enemies's AOE damage.
- Dreadpaw (Beast - Summoner) / Mantakor (Kraken - Puppet - Summoner) - The new update require only 2 Summoners to active the synergy, you don't have to buy all 2 of them to corporate with Illusionist. However, if you're a fan of Summoner team (like me), grab them all!

### IDEAL ARMY

### EARLY GAME

Psyker early game is not that much important. Feel free to grab anything you want (because your core heroes usally not come up this stage). To make a good first impression, buy the tankiest hero of the five you see in the store. Don't forget to group at least 1 synergy before the real battle start. Some suggestions is:

#### Beast - Vanguard

Early game Vanguard is not a bad choice, and these heroes is ultra common.

Vanguard x 3 | Tusker, Acidtooth, Blademaster
Beast x 2 | Tusker, Acidtooth

This is also a composition if you not lucky enough to get Blademaster. 3 beast heroes can help you reach level 2 Beast sooner in mid game.

Beast x 3 | Tusker, Razorclaw, Acidtooth

#### Guardian - Walker
You will however need a Guardian to pair with Ironshell in late game. Buy them at early game is a good start.

Walker | Vajra
Guardian x 2 | Vajra, Paviser

Have you ever try this?

Walker | ☆☆ Vajra, ☆ Vajra

### MID GAME

![Mid game](/assets/img/posts/2019-06-21-mid-game.png)

This is the most important phase of the build. Buy any psyker on sight!

#### If you got your Illusionist
Find a Dreadpaw or Mantakor

#### If you got your Chanter
Find your Soulmentor

#### If you got all 4 Psyker
Nice, keep it for your self if you're not lucky enough to get Ironshell in late game!

### LATE GAME

This is the most tactical phase of the build. Ironshell is not like Sunfire (a hero that you can just buy and place it anywhere waiting for her to burn your enemy to hell), he's hard to find and not easy to use.

Spend your coin to get to Lv.9, at this point what you should do depend on the fact that you have Ironshell or not.

#### If you got an Ironshell

Congratulations! Stop level up wherever you are. Because Ironshell is only that strong if you got less piece on the chess, you should spend all your coins refreshing the shop trying to get others ☆☆☆ heroes. Place Ironshell somewhere that he can take as many damage as possible. If your enemies go full Assassin, move him to the back of your army, taunt their killer to death.

![Late game](/assets/img/posts/2019-06-21-late-game.png)

Beware of AOE damage, especially when your army are full of tankers. Separate your chess heroes, putting them on the Avoiding AOE Formation, or bring alone Ironshell to the face of the enemies and put all your heroes on the back letting him swallows all the income damage.

#### If you can't find Ironshell

Sorry to hear that! Fortunately, we got you a plan B. Use the Chanter + Illusionist + Hierophant + Thunderer mixture. It sounds like a poor version of Ironshell but it's the best that you got (before Ironshell come out Psyker team is just fine by the way).

You can replace Ironshell with other 5 coin heroes that you saw on the shop. Buy Forest Rager if you already got Vinewarden on your team, Hailstorm if you gone Mech, Mirage Caller if you have Mantakor,... Looking for the 6th Beast is also a good idea.

### NOTE
Every build have their own weakness. Psyker Era weakness can easily be solved by good positioning skill and macro management. The only thing you would have to worry much is your luck, looking for Ironshell sometime harder than looking for a coin fall down from the sky!
