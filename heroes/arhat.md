### Tips
Arhat used to be the champion that have the worst skill targeting in the game. When he fully charged his skill, he shot at nothing! After the 0606 update, the target of Arhat's Spiritfire Beam changed to a random enemy rather than the enemy that he is fighting against, he is a worth playing champion.
