*No one knows how long Ironshell will live. Thick Crystalcore deposited has been a natural museum. And time has taught him much about life. 
Therefore, when enemies outnumbers allies, he retreats, while secretly controls the battle; when allies outnumbers enemies, he will be back to the battle. Now this philosopher joins AoE battle.*

### Tips

- Ironshell will change his shape according to the number comparison of enemies and allies.
- Defend form enables him to become the only target of all enemies. This form makes him the tankiest heroes of the game.
- Offend form enables his base attack to transform to AoE attack. Because Ironshell base DPS is not so impressive, he's not mainly use for this purpose.
- Using Ironshell in 10 battles and you will unlock a new avatar!
