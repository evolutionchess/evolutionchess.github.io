### Tips
Kamikaze used to be one of the best tank heroes of the game. Before she die, she can take like 5 more hits and will not be stunned or petrified. Since update 0620, Kamikaze will release her ability the moment she receives the deadly blow. This is a big nerf to Kamikaze and the Insectoid team in general.
