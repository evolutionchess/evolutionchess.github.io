### Tips
- If Mindbreaker is killed, the unit which is charmed will return normal immediately.
- The Mindbreaker will randomly choose an enemy to charm, rather than choose the highest HP one in previous version.
- When your mindbreak spider charms an enemy spider, and the enemy spider then charms another enemy unit1, unit1 will not switch camp permanently.
