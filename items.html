<p>Items are equipments that can be equipped on your chess pieces to improve their performance on the board. You can find them by defeated Creeps. Creeps are neutral hostile that appear at round 1-3, 10 and every 5 rounds after then. The odds of receiving higher tier items is better the stronger the enemy. There are 5 tiers of item rarity, from common to legendary.</p>
<p>You can equip the item on one of your heroes at any stage of the game, but it only takes affect until the next round. Once item is equipped, they can't be unequipped. However, you can get the item back by selling the unit wearing it.</p>
