Synergies in Arena of Evolution: Red Tides are special passive and active skills that the heroes receive if they are in one army with other heroes of the same type. For example: if a Gorilla and a Marauder is in the same army, they will active the Lv.1 [Mech Synergy](#Mech), which gave all Mechs +15 health regeneration. There are 2 types of synergies: [Spec](#spec-synergies) (or Race, such as Marine, Mech, Beast, Walker,...) and [Class](#class-synergies) (such as Assassin, Longshot, Supporter,...). They are incredibly important and must be taken into account when planning your army.

Multiple same heroes are only counted as one in the synergy. For example: If you have two Sniper, they don't count as two Marine, so they won't activate the Lv.1 [Marine Synergy](#Marine). Some classes are good at an early stage of the game, others in the middle and some later. Remember this and don't be afraid to change your strategy and sell parts of heroes.

Some class and spec not only have a synergy but also have a unique combat skill. For example: when the battle start, [Assassin](#Assassin) will jump to the back of the enemies, dealing damage to the carrier (others class will fight whatever in front of them). [Walker](#Walker) only strong when they're alone, adding more Walker will break the Synergy,...
